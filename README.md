To create a copy of this repository in RStudio follow these steps:

1. On a web browser open RStudio Server at https://stats3.sgul.ac.uk/rstudio and login. Close down any old RSession and start a new one
2. File menu > New project...
3. Choose: Version Control > Git
4. Paste the following address into the "Repository URL" field: https://github.com/alanmichaelpittman100/RNA-Seq-Workshop-SGUL
5. Press tab key ("Project directory name" field will be filled automatically)
6. Choose a desired folder in the "Create project as subdirectory of..." field
7. Click the "Create project" button
8. Switch version of Rstudio in top right hand corner to 3.4.3 !important!
9. Open the Rmarkdown file ("RNASeq_Workshop_in_R_stats3_V1.Rmd") and begin to follow the instructions therein on the first dataset.
10. The blocks of code can either be executed by clicking the green arow in the right hand side of each box, or can be pasted and run in the Rstudio console at the bottom left. 


Experiment 2

Here will analyse a slightly different and more complex set of data in DESeq2. This time we have two different cell lines that are either treated or untreated.

1. Open the file ("Experiment2.R") by clicking on it in the bottom right hand pane.
2. Begin to follow the instructions therein on this second dataset.
3. In this instance we are using an Rscript file, rather than and Rmarkdown file. Blocks of code can either be executed with the "run" button or pasted into the console below.
4. Take the time to sytematically go through the commands.


Enjoy !
